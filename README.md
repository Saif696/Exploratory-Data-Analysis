# Exploratory Data Analysis on Red Wine Dataset

## Objective
This project analyzes the `Red Wine Quality` dataset to understand trends, correlations, and outliers, ultimately helping in determining wine quality.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- Format: CSV
- Features include acidity, residual sugar, alcohol, and quality scores.

## Process
1. Data Loading
2. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
3. Visualization of Distributions and Correlations
4. Insights and Conclusions

## Visualizations
- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Correlation Heatmaps

## Insights
- Alcohol content and density strongly correlate with wine quality.
- Feature distributions suggest the need for preprocessing steps in predictive modeling.
